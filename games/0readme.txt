                    THE SCOTT ADAMS COLLECTION 2.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                      (c) Scott Adams, 1978-84

This archive contains 17 copyrighted Scott Adams adventures, plus a
freely distributable sampler, all of them converted to "ScottFree"
format.

These text adventures were commercially distributed in the 1970s and
1980s. Today they are distributed as Shareware. Please take the time to
read the Shareware notice (underneath the Contents section).


Scott Adams wrote his "Adventure" games between 1978 and 1985. The
first games were text-only games with an interpreter written in BASIC,
later releases had faster interpreters written in assembler. From 1983
onwards he re-released all the games with added graphics (SAGA, Scott
Adams Graphic Adventures). 

The games included here are the text-only versions. To play them you
will need the interpreter "ScottFree" which is available in many
different flavors (UNIX, PC/DOS, PC/Windows, Amiga...) from the
Interactive Fiction Archive at
  ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/scott-adams/

Have fun, and happy nostalgia!

                             Playing Hints
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw a map as you go, there are a lot more places than you think and
without a map you will end up going round in circles or missing areas
which you haven't tried. It doesn't need to be perfect as long as you
have some record of where you have been and what you've found (as well
as where you found it). Examine things you find and try to remember
that most problems have solutions that require no more than some
careful thought and a little common sense. If you get stuck try typing
HELP -- you may or may not get assistance but you won't know until you
ask. And be careful about assuming things, it can be fatal.

To speed things up you may use the following abbreviations N, S, E, W,
U, D, for Go North, South, East, West, Up or Down. I is short for
Inventory and will list what you're carrying.

Some (but not all) of the words available that you may find useful
are: --

Get, Take, Drop, Go, Climb, Jump, Enter, Examine, Go, Leave, Move,
Quit, Say, Wear, Read, Save, Light, Pull, Push and Look ... There are
others!!!

Instructions are entered by you in the form of two word commands with
the first word being a verb. If the computer doesn't understand, it
will tell you so and you must try rewording what you wish to do (e.g.
instead of GO FLYING try FLY). You will find that objects which can be
picked up usually require only the last part of their name as in the
Blue Ox where typing GET OX is all that is needed.

Good luck, happy adventuring and try not to die too often.
